### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an ecologist, with interest in both, plants and birds. My research is quite interdisciplinary, and includes invasion ecology, landscape ecology and forest mensuration. 
I am currently working on Terrestrial Laser Scanning data analyses at University of New Brunswick, Canada. 
I am looking for postdoctoral opportunities.
