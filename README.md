### Hi there 👋🏼
>I am an ecologist, with interest in plants and birds. My research is interdisciplinary, and includes invasion ecology, landscape ecology and forest mensuration. 
I am currently working on Terrestrial Laser Scanning data analyses at University of New Brunswick, Canada. 
I am also looking for postdoctoral opportunities.


#### Invasion Ecology

>##### Invader-facilitated Invasion
>What are the patterns of understory plant regeneration in invasive timber landscapes for invasive species?

#### Climate and Landscape Change
>What are the patterns of landscape change in tropical mountainous regions, and how does the interaction with climate change affect the range?

>>To study the interactive impacts of climate and land cover change, the mountain range needs to be mapped based on the intensity of these changes. Understanding the overlap between the future changes in climate and land cover will help mark the regions across the range based on the extent of alteration and the driver of the changes those regions might face. Annual precipitation and annual minimum temperature are important climatic variables that define the distribution of floral and faunal components on most mountaintops. With the land cover change, such maps can help decide the most vulnerable zones in a mountain range, which can help focus the conservation actions.

>##### Climate Velocity
> What are the patterns of the speed and direction that a species at a given point in space would need to move to remain within its climatic niche?
